To do

Renel:
1.	Tie Callin's updated map data and cost info into the app
2.	Record what people’s responses are for the algorithm
3.	Change color of beaches on prediction map to a color scale explaining how well their model performed on that beach
4.  Re-group beaches based on correlations
5.  Fix issue with fonts not showing up on graphs. Callin, do you know an easy way to do this?
6.  Fix bug where any hit rate below 10% returns NA


Callin:
1.	Give Renel predictions for each individual beach as output to tie it to the map 
2.	Make sure the verbiage in each tab is accurate.
3.	Fix error when selecting every beach for the algorithm.
4.	Fix issue when you select no beaches
5.  Get Renel $ value for cost of a false alarm
6.  Get Renel $ value for cost of a test
7.  To make the algorithm run faster: since the output to the "Model Summary" is always the same for USGS, can we take those calculations
    out of commission and just let the graphs pull from a static text file for the USGS results?
8.  Why does the USGS model always have roughly double the number of false alarms as the user's model? Are we sure the algorithm is working
    the way we intend it to?
