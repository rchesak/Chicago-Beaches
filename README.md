# Chicago-Beaches
Renel Chesak (@rchesak) built a Shiny app for understanding the E. coli levels at your Chicago beaches:
https://rchesak.shinyapps.io/e-coli-beach-predictions/

The above app can also be found on the City of Chicago's website: http://chicago.github.io/clear-water/challenge/index.html

The algorithm used in this app was built by the City of Chicago's Department of Innovation and Technology (@cityofchicago), and it's incorporation into this app would not have been possible without the help of my friend and former city intern, Callin Osborn (@CallinOsborn).
